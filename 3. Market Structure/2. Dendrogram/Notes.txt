# Skeleton/Scope of the Dendrogram enhancements
1. Collect the data from the source/team
2. Enlist all attributes required for the Dendrogram
3. Determine the attributes(significant) based on the pre-defined rules/conditions prior plotting the dendrogram: Pruning attributes
4. Plot the dendrogram for only those prunned attributes
5. Name the nodes based on the characteristics of the attributes for the respective items responsible for that Node creation. Ideally, determine those attributes(Names) with conditions/rules like with more than 50% share or max share from the respective items
